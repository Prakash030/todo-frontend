This application supports login, register, and Google Authentication.

In this application, we can do the CRUD operation for each task created.

We can also drag and drop the tasks into different sections. Also, the search bar is present along with the Recent first Filter.

All authentications have been taken care and the application is fully authenticated.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
